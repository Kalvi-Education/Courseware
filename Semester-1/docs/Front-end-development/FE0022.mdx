Road map for learning this lesson

Milestone 1: Read the article and watch the video to understand, what is overflow and the values that we can pass to it. (the time required to read this section is 10 minutes)

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflowing_content#what_is_overflow) describes overflow as “Everything in CSS is a box. You can constrain the size of these boxes by assigning values of width and height (or inline-size and block-size). Overflow happens when there is too much content to fit in a box. CSS provides various tools to manage overflow.”

  

If you wanted to watch a video on Overflowing, here is a video for you.

[Click Here](https://youtu.be/yF5p7A8J9VY) to learn about Overflow in CSS.(7 minutes).

By watching this video you will learn about

1.  How to control overflow(using the hidden property).
    
2.  How to add a scroll bar.
    
3.  How to control overflow in x and y directions independently.
    

  

Milestone 2: Here, in the article, you have got two examples that demonstrate the default behavior of CSS when there is an overflow.

## CSS tries to avoid "data loss"

Here is an interesting [article by free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-overflow-explained-with-examples/) which will help you understand Overflowing content better.

  

Milestone 4: Now in this section, you will learn about “Overflow establishes a Block Formatting Context” and “Unwanted overflow in web design”.

## Overflow establishes a Block Formatting Context

[Click Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflowing_content#overflow_establishes_a_block_formatting_context) to learn and practice “Overflow establishes a Block Formatting Context”.

## Unwanted overflow in web design

[Click Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflowing_content#unwanted_overflow_in_web_design) to learn about “Unwanted overflow in web design”.

  

By now we would have known about Overflowing contents in CSS.

  

[Click Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflow_Tasks) to test your skills on “Overflow”. There are 2 tasks in this link, try to complete both.

  

Voila, that’s the end of all the concepts in this lesson. Now, time for an exercise!

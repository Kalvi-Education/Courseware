## Text Properties in CSS

CSS provides several properties to manage the display of text. The most common ones are listed below:

-   direction: sets the direction of text flow.
    
-   letter-spacing: sets the amount of space between letters.
    
-   line-height: sets the amount of space between the baseline of two lines.
    
-   text-align: sets the justification properties of text.
    
-   text-decoration: determines how to use a line to decorate the text.
    
-   text-indent: sets the amount of space to indent before each line of text in a block.
    
-   text-transform: sets whether upper-case letters or lower-case letters are used.
    
-   word-spacing: sets the amount of space between two words.

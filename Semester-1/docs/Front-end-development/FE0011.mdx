# Debugging HTML

  

Welcome to the lesson on Front-end web development. This would be a self-paced class which focuses on one of the fundamental topics in HTML - Debugging. In this lesson, we will learn how to use DevTools or DOM-Inspectors in our browsers to analyse HTML codes and find errors.

  

Please make sure that you are completing the entire lesson.

## What are your learning goals in this lesson

Goal 1: Understanding what is Debugging

Goal 2: Understanding why we should debug our HTML Codes

Goal 3: Learning different ways to debug HTML

## What is Debugging?

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML) describes “Debugging as the process of locating and removing coding mistakes in computer programs. The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works”.

By now, we would have got a very good undertaking on “What is Debugging”, let’s look at its need.

## Why Should We Debug Our HTML Codes?

Let us look at two versions of a webpage to understand the reason why we should learn Debugging HTML.

[Version 1 :](https://web-platform-9zxpfa.stackblitz.io)

[Version 2:](https://web-platform-amjga5.stackblitz.io)

When you open the version 1 webpage in your browser, you'll see that the page looks messed up. The main section of the page is overlapping the navigation bar, the navbar list items are out of the navigation bar. That’s because the HTML code contains some errors which are ignored by the browser. On the other hand, version 2 is error-free and looks like a well-coded webpage.

  

Now that we have established the need for debugging, let’s dive deep into how to do that.

  

Here is an interesting [article by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML) which will help you understand Debugging better.

How to work with exercise

This exercise has 5 bugs in the HTML code. You are expected to debug them one after the other.

You can find the instructions for debugging your HTML code in the boilerplate file as comments you can also use [https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) for debugging HTML.

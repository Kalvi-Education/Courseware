# Need for programming languages

## Introduction

As we know that if you need to communicate with you need a specific language to communicate.

  

For example, if you need to communicate with two people, one person knows Hindi and the other person knows Telugu. In this case you need to identify the common language between them to communicate with each other. At that time you hear that both of them are able to understand and speak in English. So that you can communicate with them by using the English language.

  

Similarly, some specific languages are needed to communicate with computers, and those languages are called programming languages.

  

>A programming language is a set of instructions written in a specific language to perform a specific task. It is mainly used to develop desktop applications, operating systems, websites, mobile applications, etc.

  

## Objectives of programming languages

-   Some languages, such as C, are designed to produce efficient code to be run on small computer systems.
    
-   Some languages, such as Pascal and Simula, are designed to teach programming concepts to beginners.
    
-   Some languages, such as Fortran, are designed to produce efficient numeric calculations.
    
-   Some languages, such as COBOL, are designed to provide readable syntax for financial and other business applications.
    
-   Some languages, such as Ada, are designed to combine reliability, robustness, readability, and execution efficiency.
    
-   Some languages, such as Python, are designed to produce programs with minimal effort.
    

  
  

## Why do we need to know about programming languages?

Studying programming languages will help you be better at your job, make more money, and be a happier, more fulfilled and more informed citizen, because you’ll learn to:

-   Choose the most appropriate language for a given task.
    
-   Learn new languages more easily.
    
-   Use the languages you do use more productively
    
-   Design your own language.
    
-   Encounter fascinating ways of programming you might never have imagined before.
    

  
  

## Types of programming language

## 1. Low-level programming language

Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.

  

## 2. High-level programming language

High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).

  

>The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.

  

>High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.

  
  

## 3. Middle-level programming language

Middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming language and the high-level programming language. It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.

  

>A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language.

  

>Example: C, C++, language

  
  

## History of programming languages: A timeline

Listed below is a timeline of the history of programming languages. The first known programming languages were complicated machine codes that were manually inputted into early computing machines. As you’ll discover, computer programming developed quickly from machine codes to fully automated human-readable code.

  

### 1843: Ada Lovelace’s machine algorithm

Ada Lovelace invents the first-ever machine algorithm for Charles Babbage’s Difference Machine that lays the foundation for all programming languages.

### 1949: Assembly Language

Assembly language was used in the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). Assembly language was a type of low-level programming language that simplified the language of machine code. In other words, the specific instructions necessary to operate a computer.

  
  

### 1949: Shortcode

Shortcode (or Short-order code), was the first High-Level Language (HLL) suggested by John McCauley in 1949. However, it was William Schmitt who implemented it for the BINAC computer the same year and for the UNIVAC in 1950.

  

### 1952: Autocode

Autocode was a general term used for a family of programming languages. First developed by Alick Glennie for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester, Autocode was the first-ever compiled language to be implemented meaning that it can be translated directly into machine code using a program called a compiler. Autocode was used on the Ferranti Pegasus and Sirius early computing machines in addition to the Mark 1.

  

### 1957: FORTRAN

FORmula TRANslation or FORTRAN was created by John Backus and is considered to be the oldest programming language in use today. The programming language was created for high-level scientific, mathematical, and statistical computations. FORTRAN is still in use today in some of the world’s most advanced supercomputers.

### 1958: ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)

Algorithmic language or ALGOL was created by a joint committee of American and European computer scientists. ALGOL served as the starting point for the development of some of the most important programming languages including Pascal, C, C++, and Java.

  

### 1958: LISP (List Processor)

List processor or LISP was invented by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT). Originally purposed for artificial intelligence, LISP is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today and can be used in the place of Ruby or Python. Companies such as Acceleration, Boeing, and Genworks are still using LISP in their tech stacks.

### 1959: COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language)

Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), is the programming language behind many credit card processors, ATMs, telephone and cell calls, hospital signals, and traffic signals systems (just to name a few). The development of the language was led by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper and was designed so that it could run on all brands and types of computers. COBOL is still used to this day primarily for banking and gamification systems.

## What old programming languages are still used today?

Not all programming languages last forever. Whether it’s a result of developments in technology or simply being replaced by a more sophisticated language. With that said, there are some old programming languages that are still being used by IT professionals today:

  

**FORTRAN**

The initial version of FORTRAN was proposed at IBM by John Backus way back in 1953. It was the first optimizer compiler and was widely used for scientific work because it’s optimised code competed favourably with hand-written assembly code. The language is still used to this day on some of the world’s fastest supercomputers. There have been a string of updates since 1953 with the most recent version released in 2018.

  

**COBOL**

COBOL was developed back in 1959 and was one of the first high-level programming languages. Despite being invented so long ago COBOL is still hugely prevalent today. In the US alone, 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL, accounting for 95% of ATM swipes, and 80% of in-person transactions.

Early Microsoft and Apple Programming Languages

Microsoft and Apple are two of the most fundamental companies in the history of programming languages. BASIC (first released in 1964), was modified by Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Their modified version became Altair BASIC, which was the first marketed and distributed product of Microsoft, and led to the creation of the company.

  

>Pascal was the programming language of choice during the early days of Apple. Invented in the early 1970s, Apple developers liked Pascal because of its power and ease of use. However, when Apple acquired the NeXTSTEP code library in 1996, Objective-C (which was licensed under NeXTSTEP) became the popular language of choice for the tech giant.

  

What is the most popular programming language today?

We’re nearing the end of our journey through the history of programming languages. As you’ve seen, computer programming has developed to a level beyond all expectation, powering the technology that we rely on a daily basis. It’s for this reason that we need skilled professionals to implement and control the programming languages that power the world today.

  

## But which programming language is the most popular?

  

The DevSkiller 2020 IT Skills Report provides valuable insight for precisely that question. The report contains data from over 213,000 coding tests sent across 143 countries by companies looking to hire specialised IT professionals.

  

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aHYYMB4yfo40tr3x8QLAWXBEv7CQEbJUNWgXzuZAvktObjZNILnE6ouDMnY9e-Z7j7KBHs7b0GY6LLHJ0yBv14fHHhznyMtahX7e6Usg8Lo9R0eBqN01C9yUKlK1E_fmwzvGq-coPT27-QnupQw)

  

As you can see above, JavaScript was the most popular language tested on DevSkiller based on the test invites that were sent out. This finding is confirmed in the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey which lists JavaScript as the most popular programming language for the eighth year in a row. SQL, Java, HTML/CSS, and .NET/C# rounded out the top 5 in our results.

  

## Conclusion

The history of programming languages is fascinating. Who would have thought that an algorithm from the mid-19th century would pave the way for the technology-driven society we live in today. From early machine codes to the sophisticated human-readable code that powers our favourite technologies today, programming languages have come a long way. What’s for certain, computer programming will continue to develop as it has done for the past 150 years and it’s exciting to see what the future brings.

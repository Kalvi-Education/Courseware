# HTML Text Fundamentals

### What are your learning goals in this lesson

Goal 1: Headings and paragraphs in HTML

Goal 2: HTML List

Goal 3: Emphasis and importance in HTML

### What are HTML Text Fundamentals?

As described by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals): “One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.”

  

### Why do we need structure in HTML?

Here is a [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#why_do_we_need_structure) which helps you understand why we need structure.

  

### Why do we need semantics?

Here is a [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#why_do_we_need_structure) which helps you understand why we need structure.

  

Now that we have established the need for structuring, let’s dive deep into how to do that.

  

## Headings and paragraphs in HTML:

As described in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#the_basics_headings_and_paragraphs): “Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.

Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.

  

In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <p> element, like so:

  

    <p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>

  

Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:

  

    <h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>

  

There are six heading elements: `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>`. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; `<h1>` represents the main heading, `<h2>` represents subheadings, `<h3>` represents sub-subheadings, and so on.”

  

Here is a [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#implementing_structural_hierarchy) which will help you understand Implementing structural hierarchy.

## HTML List:

As described by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#lists): “Lists are everywhere in life—from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! Lists are everywhere on the web, too, and we've got three different types to worry about.”

  

Here is a [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#lists) which will help you understand different types of lists in HTML. please go through the section “[Unordered list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#unordered)”, “[Ordered list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#ordered)” & “[nesting list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#nesting_lists)”.

  

Here are a few resources on how to create lists.

## Emphasis and importance in HTML

As described by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#emphasis_and_importance): “In human language, we often emphasize certain words to alter the meaning of a sentence, and we often want to mark certain words as important or different in some way. HTML provides various semantic elements to allow us to mark up textual content with such effects, and in this section, we'll look at a few of the most common ones.”

  

Here is a [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#emphasis_and_importance) which will help you understand Emphasis and importance in HTML. please go through the section “[Emphasis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#emphasis)”, “[Strong importance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#strong_importance)” & “[Italic, bold, underline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#italic_bold_underline)”.

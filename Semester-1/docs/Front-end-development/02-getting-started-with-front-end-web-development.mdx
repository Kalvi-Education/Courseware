Welcome to the lesson on Front-end web development. This lesson is a **self-paced lesson** which focuses on setting up a basic web development environment, understanding the basics of files, get to know what is HTML, CSS & JS. Please make sure that you are completing the entire lesson.


## Welcome to the Front End Web Development course

Hey Kalvian!

We are super excited ü§© to introduce you to the amazing world of coding through this Front end web development course. 

## About this course

- **Course duration:** 21 weeks course
- **No. of modules in the course:** 7 modules 
- **Duration of a module:** 3 weeks 
- **No. of hours dedicated for this course per week:** 15 hours 

This course will not be like a traditional course where teacher/mentor teaches the concepts to the students, instead this course will involve a lot of self-paced lessons. The reason why this course is designed with more focus on self-paced learning, is because we at kalvi and a lot of tech experts beleive that this is a best way to learn Front-end web develoment.

This course is made up of different modes of lessons, here are the different modes and its details.
- **Lecture:** This is a live lesson in which Kalvi's Mentor will be teaching the lesson.
- **Self-paced lesson:** This is a self-paced lesson where studnets will be learning and practicing the concept in Kalvi's learning platform.
- **Lab:** This is a self-paced lesson where you will work on practically implementing some of the most exciting concepts you have been learning in Front-end Web Development.
- **Code-along:**  Code-along is a live class lesson in which you will code with the mentor to practically apply the concepts learnt in the previous studies in a project.
- **TSI (Teacher Student interactions):** TSI will be an interactive live season, where teachers and students will be discussing crucial technical interview questions and go deeper into the concepts learnt previously by using Inquiry-based learning. 
- **Module Assessment:** This is a project-based assessment which will be happening at the end of every module, where you will be assessed based on your project.

## Kalvi's Promise

Let‚Äôs get started üëç

## What is Front End?

The fact that we could create this course and you could learn it online is not all easy. We all owe it to one person, Sir Tim Berners Lee, the brain behind the World Wide Web (www). He also created HTML and HTTP along with the first web page editor, the browser.

All these technologies helped him create the first website ever. Sounds interesting! So you see, that's how technology evolved.

And today, every website has two parts to it - Front End and Back End. You can probably visualize them this way,

Understanding & working on both FrontEnd & BackEnd together is a little overwhelming. So, in this semester let's first focus on Front-End for the next few months. 
Front-end development involves building web pages and user interfaces for web applications. 

A Front-end developer implements the structure, design, behaviour, and animation of everything you see on the screen when you open up web applications or mobile apps.

Frontend development stands firmly on three pillars: HTML for markup, CSS for styling and JavaScript for logic and interactions.

Creating beautiful webpages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would precisely compose the frontend of your web applications.

By now you would have got a good understanding about Front-end, it is very cruical to understand of **What** and **How** of Web develoment.

## What is web development?

This is what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) says ‚ÄúWeb development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.‚Äù 

Let's watch a short video to understand **what is Web development?**

## How web works?

<Youtube videoId="hJHvdBlSxug" />

By now you would have got a better clarity on what is web and how it works. Let's take our first step in Front-end web development.

The first step is to set up all the required environments to work with during the course. This way, there are no distractions in between. 


## Environment setup

Here is a video on getting started with web development.

<Youtube videoId="kUMe1FH4CHE" start="55" end="1212" />

Here are the concepts covered in this video:

1. Installing VS code
2. Installing Google chrome
3. Working with VS code
4. Get to know what is HTML
5. Understanding the basics of files

### Environment setup reference  

#### Installing VS Code

VS Code includes great tooling for web technologies such as JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON. Throughout the course, we'll be using the VS code extensively. It is not just an editor, the features supported by VS Code reduce the tasks of any developer significantly. Along with VS code, we will be installing a few additional extensions too.

System requirements for the VS Code:

Visual Studio Code is a small download (&lt; 100 MB) and has a disk footprint of 200 MB. VS Code is lightweight and should easily run on today's hardware.

**How to install VS Code?**

- Open VS Code in your browser using this link -  [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

- Now VS code would have detected your OS.

- Download and install VS Code for your system (follow the instructions for installation)

After installing VS Code editor, you need to install some basic plugins to make the platform a better place to code. So, install these as well:

- ESLint - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

- Beautify - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)

- Prettier - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

- Live Server - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Now you‚Äôre all set with your environment.

#### Install/Update chrome

[Click here to download the installation file](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiKzR3_mC5wIVkIWPCh0S2AoxEAAYASABEgIsvvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

- If prompted, click Run or Save.

- If you have chosen Save, then double-click the downloaded file to begin the installation.

- Now, start Chrome:


**üö® Note:** If you've earlier used a different browser, like Internet Explorer or Safari or Edge, you can import your settings into Chrome.

If Chrome is already installed, make sure you have the latest version of it. To check this on your computer, open Chrome.

- At the top right, click More (three dots option).

- Click update Google Chrome.

> **Important:** If you don't see this button, you're on the latest version.

- Click relaunch.

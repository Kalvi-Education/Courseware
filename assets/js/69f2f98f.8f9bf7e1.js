You now have a clear path to the goal. ."),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Solution:")),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Brown and Yellow block completely to the left end."),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Orange ball to coordinates (2,4)"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Brown block to the 1st row"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"ball downward to the hole.")),(0,l.kt)("blockquote",null,(0,l.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"This is a type of problem that will drive you to think 3 to 4 moves ahead of the current condition.")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Follow up")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Now try to solve the remaining examples on your own."),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Follow up questions")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Question 1:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rYaIdeH-6LBLwOLFn58mhQRvzsf6YJwh3kAIWAeJgka9zIQls_jp38RrC4anWZAvzfg_FuO7XMb1EHWyFyHLhNzCHvu7qdzZhsRFX8NtwE_N4dzl_qVIyPN8yU7JU2zZ2BIyJHx8TMHnRp8pmzoKGiM",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("details",null,(0,l.kt)("summary",null,"Check the Solution!"),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Purple block \u2013 1 row \u2193"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Orange ball to coordinates (2,2)"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Green block \u2013 2 rows \u2191"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Purple block \u2013 1 column \u2190"))),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Question 2:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8Y73Nq-2f5Bvz_jbnMC1axieG5ErDe0BABCBcXXRohcP1-I9BrX2DKEv_xg-F0DUZ3uz-2LpQT8xKyWcD_cRMnOk79D4Ly1uziu5BAfpRE5BveMhFYjY6BvbOxXHdTTM9cXulk6r8uJtTC4H7jS0g8M",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("details",null,(0,l.kt)("summary",null,"Check the Solution!"),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Orange ball to coordinates (3,3)"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Green block \u2013 1 row \u2193"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Purple block \u2013 1 column \u2190"))),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Question 3:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6W8SzqNZmhgKITNfezqqFRaLdp8cgw7qsvB0n0oc4Ek5CuxuLDT7otRa88U0i3Pn8acT79u6ireIgYjMhfZAaCsR2H1vVqjUPCD-gVmV2pL6HMtntkpt-rPojQZiDOeh4c3DFOo1kr1X-JIcRLZgYbQ",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("details",null,(0,l.kt)("summary",null,"Check the Solution!"),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Purple block \u2013 1 column \u2192"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Orange ball to coordinates (1,3)"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Green block \u2013 2 rows \u2191"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Yellow block \u2013 2 columns \u2192"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Brown block \u2013 1 row \u2193"))),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Question 4:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oRUh7R1DqHfAAVO-gydrAsAlg7SBEPxeU2lb1-R_QbQSwymIYLDoPyRinrNJFCX_JH8XHyNfoyxK-Cn8M8Cnn73acvQlTeBCLvgz7vREnyOBGBtN-VNErppzWnXzGfCEufKHsTqLalpVz5rTs8ziCCM",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("details",null,(0,l.kt)("summary",null,"Check the Solution!"),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Blue block \u2013 2 rows \u2191"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Yellow block \u2013 1 column \u2190"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Purple block \u2013 1 column \u2192"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Pink block \u2013 1 column \u2192 and 1 row \u2191"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Brown block \u2013 1 column \u2190, 2 rows \u2191 and 1 column \u2192"))),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Under the hood \ud83d\udca1 To solve more such problems with visuals, you can refer to the lesson ",(0,l.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://kalvi-education.github.io/Courseware/Semester-1/docs/Problem-solving-using-Programming/Solving-problems-&-Writing-Algorithms/Under-the-hood#thinking-with-visuals"},"under the hood"),"."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

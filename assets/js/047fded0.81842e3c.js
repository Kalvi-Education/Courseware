The binary of the clue actually tells you which numbers you are looking for. 12 is 1100 in binary which says that 12 is made up of one 8 (1000) and one 4 (0100) with no 2s and no units added together. The row must therefore hold an 8 and a 4. Similarly, 9 is 1001 in binary: one 8 (1000), no 4, no 2 and one unit (0001) added together, so its column must hold an 8 and a 1."),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"So the Solution to this looks like this:"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pMFRFjQHPGkVYvIm9KUTiY2oaGAkRXgi5MrRK64gpZjQCX_6mvlXs2R51cB9gO0dIp1JFFi79j3HFteo4C3MMrL-rWDzI2zzWDHiRbrGC4a_ZeF5xtoLRNNy-Kb5OAybxjaHJgS9UVyIR60KNg",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Follow up:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Now try solving these questions by your own:"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Que 1:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iLM2QesDWeDa4ZFwKrJnz-cw0vtgXaJ9bugNBdzvIaD3HPYxsUKVVGWIMp9oTgrXDffJiQgZEdrNLIrSDlxqQp9TWc-5UXKQOrPWS6nCegfSjp7qdrumO-ypXCZ7wEKk3MxvmhFybqWWD76_VA",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Solution 1:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ewPtHIogIOquHfsgy10eJuxtsHcqOw81JC8yhIad5C8ELinzi9CNmHEddhDltcaskISDNyDMuMwuAwIQw7m5rDaLbFSIRzy7gtDDHh52eqYIHelXCKgCNRIQnoUKUnaQudQSpxLSkj0zefMebcE",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Que 2:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AoBiYtzOcqRJutXcSWbOQsBK5hiQDtnwbgdPxDFCvYiQJvfZFlnBTJZarT8H4f_DNj0wgFGd31-PF_pSi_2HvrMHwApTRqr8Dy9fYbTgCl5tiMoG1G4u8tpyeEOr0j4FmiRv-hVT0FJwotPD2Q",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Solution:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pJdgfZLta2KpyRfq_ioLUyfQ0AvwIn17AXz4Df75T7aaYz8GH2kPFTbyjDUwyFQKhVHkLVBO9RZYQz2SpVBzONQu9RKRvGuX6SH8qTdy30QliR24fLZnKyhYu2CbG3iLiMNOVFTtQiqmx3ecAtY",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Que 3:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3ErVX3VJ1TbyXp8JehklHyF_a6YBK9Ou9Rzm_8Gd3HLPTcDcRGLs6CW-GPTMyFNeNfS_Xb_MdX7QUHyslJ68_0cNP7jyCs8DXWazVlKJCVe8UXyLQ0vBDm_ZDSLTEs2qBTZoVZG1DpbB9Ug_yg",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Solution:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9l5u6yLgJKLkMjO28vyq1ut2HXNZhklXlsWcIxBjDomvIUHAsR-J8ZyTBPdBFLkUgLiRlcFOlmQc4U7b_3R66y6t8jd0-8O6xrNrDg33iwyiFF1b_H9UUWt7hv5e1byq4IQtqkmMJwaIipJj_xQ",alt:null})),(0,l.kt)("h2",{id:"end-of-the-lesson-assessment"},"End-of-the-lesson Assessment"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Que 1:")," In the following Cut hive Problem, find the value of a and b."),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Option A: 1,2"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Option B: 1,3"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Option C: 2,2"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Option D: None of the above"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ans:")," option B"),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Que 2:")," How many iterations will be required if the size of the array in the searching algorithm is 10 and the number to be searched is not present in the array?"),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"5"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"0"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"10"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"1")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Answer:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Option (C) 10."),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Que 3.")," The binary Representation of number 15 is:"),(0,l.kt)("ol",null,(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"1001"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"1000"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"0101"),(0,l.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"1111")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,(0,l.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Answer:")),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"Option (D) 1111"))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

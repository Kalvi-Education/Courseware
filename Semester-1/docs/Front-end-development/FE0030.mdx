[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics#what_is_a_table) describes “A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data”

  

[Click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-tables-table-tutorial-with-css-example-code/) to read the article on the HTML table, which covers the list of concepts mentioned below :

  

-   Common HTML Table tags
    
-   Table Heading
    
-   Add a Caption to a Table
    
-   Use the Scope Attribute in HTML Tables
    
-   Use Cell Spanning in an HTML Table
    
-   Add a Table Header, Body, & Footer in HTML Tables
    
-   Style HTML Tables using CSS
    

  
  

Milestone 2: Complete the “Allowing cells to span multiple rows and columns” section. This section includes some interesting articles and videos.

## Allowing cells to span multiple rows and columns

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics#allowing_cells_to_span_multiple_rows_and_columns) docs say that “ Sometimes we want cells to span multiple rows or columns. Fortunately, table headers and cells have the colspan and rowspan attributes, which allow us to do just those things. Both accept a unitless number value, which equals the number of rows or columns you want to be spanned. For example, colspan="2" makes a cell span two columns.

[Click here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_colspan_rowspan.asp) to practice multiple rows and columns (3 minutes)

  
  

Milestone 3: Quickly understand and learn the “Providing common styling to columns” section. (the time required to read this section is 10 minutes)

## Providing common styling to columns

### Styling without `<col>`

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics#providing_common_styling_to_columns) shows that” HTML has a method of defining styling information for an entire column of data all in one place — the `<col>` and `<colgroup>` elements. These exist because it can be a bit annoying and inefficient having to specify styling on columns — you generally have to specify your styling information on every `<td>` or `<th>` in the column, or use a complex selector such as :nth-child.”

### Styling with `<col>`

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics#styling_with_col) docs ” Instead of doing the above one, we can specify the information once, on a `<col>` element. `<col>` elements are specified inside a `<colgroup>` container just below the opening `<table>` tag.”

  

[Click here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_colgroup.asp) to read and practice common styling with `<col>` and `<colgroup>` (3 minutes)

  

If you wanted to watch a video on the HTML tables, here is a video for you.

[Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGBRYTpgyg4) to watch the video. (30 minutes).

By watching this video you will learn:

  

 - Create Table.
 - Row and data cells
 - Merge cells (horizontally and vertically)
 - Table header, body, and footer
 - Cell padding and cell spacing
 - Nested table

Here is an interesting [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) which will help you understand Document and website structure.

  

Road map for better learning

Milestone 1: Complete reading the whole document (the time required to read the document is 25-30 minutes) and then continue with the practices which are given below.

  

Milestone 2: Here are a couple of videos on Document and website structure.

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVmX-7XEyd4) to watch a video on semantic HTML elements (3 minutes). (`<main>`,`<header>`,`<footer>`,`<aside>` HTML elements are covered in this video).

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swWeWesZVZU) to watch a video on semantic HTML elements (2 minutes) (`<article>`,`<section>` HTML elements are covered in this video).

  

By now we would have known how to document and structure a website.

  

Voila, that’s the end of all the concepts in this lesson. Now, time for an exercise!

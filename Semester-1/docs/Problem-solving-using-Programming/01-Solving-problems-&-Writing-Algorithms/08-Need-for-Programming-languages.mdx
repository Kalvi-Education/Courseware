## Introduction

üí¨ **How would you define the word language?**

  

Communication requires a format or structure that is understood by all if it aims to be effective. If we all decided to communicate in some format or structure that was only known to us, we would not be able to convey important messages. This results in the need to develop a ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô. Aristotle defines language as a speech sound produced by human beings to express their ideas, emotions, thoughts, desires, and feelings.

  

Now look back at your definition of a language and take a moment to revise before we formally define the word.

Here is the definition of ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô; A language is a system of conventional or written symbols through which human beings, as members of social groups and participants in their culture, communicate.

  

Let‚Äôs look at an instance. If you need to communicate with two people, one person knows Hindi and the other person knows Telugu. In this case you need to identify a common language between them in order for them to communicate with each other. You speak to them in some commonly known languages and come to the conclusion that they both understand English. Now, all the three parties can effectively communicate with each other in English.

  

Similarly, some specific languages are needed to communicate with computers, and those languages are called programming languages.

  

üèÅA programming language is a set of instructions written in a specific language to perform a specific task. It is mainly used to develop desktop applications, operating systems, websites, mobile applications, etc.

  

**Need for multiple programming languages:**

-   Some languages, such as C, are designed to produce efficient code to be run on small computer systems.
    
-   Languages like Pascal and Simula are designed to teach programming concepts to beginners.
    
-   Fortran is a language designed to produce efficient numeric calculations.
    
-   Some languages, such as COBOL, are designed to provide readable syntax for financial and other business applications.
    
-   Languages such as Ada are designed to combine reliability, robustness, readability, and execution efficiency.
    
-   Some languages, such as Python, are designed to produce programs with reduced effort on the programmer‚Äôs end.
    

  

You must have now realised why multiple programming languages exist; one solution doesn‚Äôt fit all. üòì

**Why do we need knowledge on programming languages?**

Learning the fundamentals of programming can give you a competitive edge in the technology-driven world. It also enhances your logic and problem solving ability. Programming languages help you broaden your knowledge bank and be a more informed citizen. From these languages you learnt to:

-   Choose the most appropriate language for a given task.
    
-   Learn any new languages more easily
    
-   Use the languages you know more productively
    
-   Design your own language and tap into your creativity
    
-   Encounter fascinating ways of programming you might never have imagined before
    

  
  
  

## Types of programming languages

### 1. Low-level programming languages

A low-level language is a machine-dependent (machines can only understand binary 0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run at high speeds. You will learn the words compiler and interpreter from a programming perspective in subsequent chapters.

  

### 2. High-level programming languages

High-level programming languages (HLL) are designed for developing user-friendly softwares, programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language and then proceed with executing the program.

  

The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain as they are languages made to translate human words and commands into something much easier for machines to understand.

  

Some examples of high-level programming languages include Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.

  
  

### 3. Middle-level programming languages

A middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming languages and the high-level programming languages. It is also known as the intermediate programming language or pseudo-language.

  

A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language.

  

**Example:** C, C++, language

It is said that we should learn from our mistakes and even better, learn from other‚Äôs mistakes. Just to avoid repetition, let‚Äôs see what languages already exist.

## History of programming languages: A timeline

Listed below is a timeline of the history of programming languages. The first known programming languages were complicated machine codes that were manually inputted into early computing machines. As we move further you‚Äôll discover that computer programming developed quickly from machine codes to fully automated human-readable code.

### 1944-45: Konrad Zuse‚Äôs Plankalk√ºl

Somewhere between 1944-45, Konrad Zuse developed the first ‚Äòreal‚Äô programming language called Plankalk√ºl (Plan Calculus). Zuse‚Äôs language (among other things) allowed for the creation of procedures, which stored chunks of code that could be invoked over and over to perform routine operations. These are more popularly known as routines or subroutines and can be used to store chunks of code that could be [invoked](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/invoked) repeatedly to perform routine operations such as taking a square root.

### 2014: Swift

Developed by Apple as a replacement for C, C++, and Objective-C, Swift was developed with the intention to be easier than the aforementioned languages and allow less room for error. Swift‚Äôs versatility means it can be used for desktop, mobile, and cloud applications. Leading language app ‚ÄòDuolingo‚Äô launched a new app that was written in Swift.

**What old programming languages are still used today?**

Not all programming languages last forever. Whether it‚Äôs a result of developments in technology or simply being replaced by a more sophisticated language. With that said, there are some old programming languages that are still being used by IT professionals today:

  

**FORTRAN**

The initial version of FORTRAN was proposed at IBM by John Backus way back in 1953. It was the first optimizer compiler and was widely used for scientific work because it‚Äôs optimised code competed favourably with hand-written assembly code. The language is still used to this day on some of the world‚Äôs fastest supercomputers. There have been a string of updates since 1953 with the most recent version released in 2018.

  

**COBOL**

COBOL was developed back in 1959 and was one of the first high-level programming languages. Despite being invented so long ago COBOL is still hugely prevalent today. In the US alone, 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL, accounting for 95% of ATM swipes, and 80% of in-person transactions.

Early Microsoft and Apple Programming Languages

Microsoft and Apple are two of the most fundamental companies in the history of programming languages. BASIC (first released in 1964), was modified by Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Their modified version became Altair BASIC, which was the first marketed and distributed product of Microsoft, and led to the creation of the company.

  

Pascal was the programming language of choice during the early days of Apple. Invented in the early 1970s, Apple developers liked Pascal because of its power and ease of use. However, when Apple acquired the NeXTSTEP code library in 1996, Objective-C (which was licensed under NeXTSTEP) became the popular language of choice for the tech giant.

  

**What is the most popular programming language today?**

We‚Äôre nearing the end of our journey through the history of programming languages. As you‚Äôve seen, computer programming has developed to a level beyond all expectation, powering the technology that we rely on a daily basis. It‚Äôs for this reason that we need skilled professionals to implement and control the programming languages that power the world today.

  

**But which programming language is the most popular?**

  

The DevSkiller 2020 IT Skills Report provides valuable insight for precisely that question. The report contains data from over 213,000 coding tests sent across 143 countries by companies looking to hire specialised IT professionals.

As you can see above, JavaScript was the most popular language tested on DevSkiller based on the test invites that were sent out. This finding is confirmed in the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey which lists JavaScript as the most popular programming language for the eighth year in a row. SQL, Java, HTML/CSS, and .NET/C# rounded out the top 5 in our results.

  

## Conclusion

Before we conclude, let‚Äôs hear from the accomplished people in the computer field of why they feel Programming is important.

The history of programming languages is fascinating. Who would have thought that an algorithm from the mid-19th century would pave the way for the technology-driven society we live in today. From early machine codes to the sophisticated human-readable code that powers our favourite technologies today, programming languages have come a long way. What‚Äôs for certain, computer programming will continue to develop as it has done for the past 150 years and it‚Äôs exciting to see what the future brings.

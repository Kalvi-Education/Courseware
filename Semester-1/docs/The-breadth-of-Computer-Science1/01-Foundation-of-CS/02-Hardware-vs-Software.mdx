# How computers work: Hardware and software
import Youtube from "@site/src/components/Youtube";

## Lesson Objective
In this lesson you will learn how computers work on the bit level. You will also learn the various different hardware and software components along with their roles and purpose. Some of the topics in this lesson may already be known to you.  

## Introduction
You may already be familiar with what computers and computer programs are, however let us do a quick recap of some important definitions and topics.

ðŸ’­ What is a computer? 

A computer is an *electronic* machine that processes informationâ€”in other words, an **information processor**: it takes in raw information (or **data**) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it. After working on data it spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. 
 
 - Taking in information is called *input*
 
 - Storing information is better known as *memory (or storage)*
 
 - Working on information is also known as *processing*
 
 - Spitting out results is called *output*

ðŸŽ¥ Watch the following video on **"How Computers work : Hardware vs Software"**  to gain more insight on what we will be discussing further in this lesson.

## Hardware and Software

Observe the following image. What does it tell you?

Computers are essentially divided into Hardware and Software that makes it run efficiently and smoothly.


ðŸ’­ Take a minute to think about it. How would you define hardware and software?

> **Hardware** is everything that we see inside(or outside, like mouse and keyboard) of a computer with our eyes, like circuits, chips, wires, etc. fall under hardware.


> **Software** is the set of computer programs that execute a certain function. It can be a line of code, an application, a website, and a lot more. It does not have a physical existence.


### Primary functions of hardware and software

A computer uses hardware and software to execute tasks assigned. The primary thing that manages the tasks in a computer hardware is the **CPU or Central Processing Unit**. 

- It has smaller components/circuits within it which are dedicated to smaller and more exact tasks(like executing a particular mathematical equation within a set of mathematical equations). 


- It also sends and receives information from different parts of the computer. 


 *One can imagine CPU as a manager of an organisation, who knows what task can or should be given to which employee.*


 - Every command or information comes in the form of binary numbers to the CPU. Binary numbers consist of 2 numbers(0 and 1), unlike decimal numbers(0 to 9). 


 - Binary code/information is the most basic piece of software that controls all the hardware associated with it. 
 
- Actually, the 0s and 1s are translated into lower and higher voltages respectively. 


 *It is done because a machine can understand and react to 2 different voltages.*

The following table shows decimal numbers (in computer science lingo, decimal numbers are any numbers with the base 10)  and their respective binary representations.

Although the computer can understand information and data in binary form, we donâ€™t write any code using 0s and 1s. This is because the time required to write or debug a binary code will be very difficult and time consuming. In fact, we use **high-level programming languages like Python, Java and C++** to write a readable piece of code, since they somewhat resemble English(the language with which we are used to).

Just like computer hardware uses CPU to manage all tasks, computer software also uses something known as **Operating System** to manage all tasks. Operating System manages how different softwares get to use the hardware of the computer. 

**Operating system does the following tasks**

* control other softwares

* download applications

* grant permissions to softwares(to access input and output devices) 

* execute other operations. 

Whenever we switch from one application to another in our computer, the operating system facilitates that.

**Follow-up question**

Q. The camera at the back of a mobile phone is the _________ whereas, the button of the screen required to click a photo is the _________.

A. hardware, software

B. software, hardware

C. software, software

D. hardware, hardware

<details>

<summary> Check the solution! </summary>

Answer: A) hardware, software

</details>

Hardware and software are very different from each other, but they need each other to function properly. *Like typing a mail would require you to use both your keyboard/keypad and the mail application (e.g. gmail) itself.*


Thus, the hardware needs software to tell it what to do, and the software also needs hardware to get directions and information from the user.

Letâ€™s get to know about the types of hardware. 

![](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/kalvi-education.github.io/problem-solving/hwvssw3.png)

Computer hardware is divided into two categories - 

 - Internal

 - External

> Internal hardwares are found inside the computer system. Motherboard is the central circuit board found inside the system unit(CPU case) of the computer. All other hardware components such as RAM, ROM memory like hard drives and SSD, power supply, graphics card, sound card, expansion cards, processor(CPU chip). The CPU(chip) is the brain of the computer hardware, about which we have mentioned earlier. Sound card helps to generate audio, and also helps an user to use a microphone with the computer. Expansion cards are network cards, bluetooth cards, etc. to expand the computerâ€™s functionality.


> External hardware components are also called peripherals. It consists of mouse, keyboard, monitor, microphone, earphones, etc. 

External peripherals can also be divided into three categories - 

`1. Input`
Input devices are those devices, which helps the computer hardware to get information and directions from the user for the software. It includes keyboard, mouse, microphone, webcam, etc.


`2. Output`
Output devices show information and data to the user. It includes monitor, earphones, printer, etc. 


`3. Storage`
Storage devices are those external devices which store data. Pendrive, hard drives, memory card, SSD are examples of storage devices. Every storage device has its own storage capacity.

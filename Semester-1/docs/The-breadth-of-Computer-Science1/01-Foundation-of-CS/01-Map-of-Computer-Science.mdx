# A Map of Computer Science

## Lesson Objective
In this lesson, we will discuss the history, the birth and the emergence of computers. We will also discuss what the words ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù mean and how it has become such an essential topic to gain knowledge about. 

## What is computer science?
üé• Watch the following short video to get an idea of what we will be discussing in this lesson.

:speech_balloon: What do you think is the definition of computer science? Write your thoughts in the text box below.
(Insert text box here)

If we try to formally define *‚Äòcomputer science‚Äô*, you may notice that a lot of the important facts are being missed out on. There are multiple definitions of computer science that exist. Let‚Äôs see a few of them below:

This first definition is from the University of Maryland;
> "Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application."

> "Computer science is a discipline that involves the understanding and design of computers and computational processes. In its most general form it is concerned with the understanding of information transfer and transformation." - Michigan Tech University

The most concise definition of computer science that covers all its major topics is; computer science is the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information.

**Let‚Äôs move on to some important dates in the evolution of computer science.**

**Some important milestones in the history of CS**

### 1700s
**Binary Number System**
The 1700s saw the formalisation of the ‚ÄúBinary Number System‚Äù by Gottfried Leibniz. He is considered the ‚Äúfirst computer scientist‚Äù. This laid the groundwork for the field of Computer Science and digital circuitry in 1703. 

### 1800s
**Conceptual Programming Language**
Ada Lovelace who is now considered the first computer programmer published the first computer algorithm in 1843.

### 1940s 
**Bombe Machine**
1941 saw the development of an electromagnetic device conceived by Alan Turing who was considered the father of modern computer science. It was used to decrypt the unbreakable Nazi ‚ÄúEnigma‚Äù code during WWII.

**ENIAC**
The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first large-scale electronic computer. It was so physically large that it filled a 20 ft. x 40 ft. room with its 18,000 vacuum tubes. The operations were performed by reading encoded instructions into a pattern of holes punched into a paper card.

### 1950s
**Turing Test a.k.a The Imitation Game**
This test was designed by Alan Turing in 1950 to test if machines can ‚Äúthink‚Äù as humans do. This was the first step that opened doors to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

**Computer Chip**
Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments made the first functioning integrated circuit made of transistors in 1958. It was 7/16 inches x 1/16 inches in size. This paved the way for the microcomputers we see today.

### 1960s and 1970s
**Internet**
1969 saw the emergence of something we can‚Äôt possibly imagine our lives without today. The first official use of the internet was to send an email from UCLA to Stanford.

**C Programming Language**
In 1972, this procedural language was designed to provide access to memory storage. 

### 1980s and 1990s
**Macintosh Computer**
1984 saw the launch of the first successful mouse driven computer GUI. It used the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. It also had an application called MacPaint!

**World Wide Web**
Tim Berners Lee invented the ‚Äúweb‚Äù in 1989 to globally share information through hypertext. This led to the creation of fundamental components of the web like HTML, URL and HTTP. 

### 2000s and 2010s
**Netflix, iTunes and more** 
The iPhone, Netflix, iTunes Music store and a lot of more advanced and cool softwares as well as hardware was developed during this period. These technologies include all the tech we know and use so frequently today.

## Why do we need computer science?
 - Computer Science is a very widespread subject and it‚Äôs applications stretch throughout every industry, no matter how trivial. 
 
 - Computers and technology are integrated into virtually every economic sector, industry, and even organization operating in the modern economy. 
 
 - Problem solving, an essential skill for life, is the major requirement for anyone pursuing a career in the field of CS. It is a dynamic, creative and innovative field. 
 
 - Computer science is responsible for smartphones, tablets, the internet and networked communications, even social media. 
 
 - We live in a society that consumes content ‚Äì whether that be news, information, entertainment, or communication ‚Äì through screens. We are truly living in a digital age, driven by computer science. 

So, now welcome to the facinating World of Computers :wink:

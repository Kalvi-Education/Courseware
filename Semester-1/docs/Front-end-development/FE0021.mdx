Welcome to the lesson on Front-end web development. This will be a self-paced class that focuses on handling different text directions in CSS. Please make sure that you are completing the entire lesson.

  

## What are your learning goals in this lesson?

Goal 1: Understanding what is the importance of handling different text directions in CSS.

Goal 2: Learning the basics of handling different text directions in CSS.

Goal 3: Learning all the advanced writing modes.

  

Road map for learning this lesson

Milestone 1: Complete “Handling different text directions in CSS” section.(The time required to read the “Handling different text directions” section is 3 minutes) and then continue with the practices which are given below.

# What do you mean by “Handling different text directions in CSS”?

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Handling_different_text_directions) defines that “ Many of the properties and values that we have encountered so far in our CSS learning have been tied to the physical dimensions of our screen. We create borders on the top, right, bottom, and left of a box, for example. These physical dimensions map very neatly to content that is viewed horizontally, and by default, the web tends to support left-to-right languages (e.g. English or French) better than right-to-left languages (such as Arabic).”

  

Get ready for exploring all the different text directions in CSS.

  

By now we would have got a very good undertaking on “What is the importance of handling different text directions in CSS”, let’s explore its types.

  
  
  

Milestone 2: Complete the sub-topics of “Handling different text directions in CSS” given below:-

## What are writing modes?

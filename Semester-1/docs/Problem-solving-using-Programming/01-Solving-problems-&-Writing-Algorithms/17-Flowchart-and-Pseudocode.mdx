## Lesson Objective

In this lesson we will be learning about **flowcharts and pseudocode** in detail by drawing and writing them for some example problems. As you already know, both of these are techniques to represent algorithms and programming logic. They are important because they help us to explain our programming logic better and in a clear way to someone else and also it enables us to debug any error in our logic.

## Flowcharts

You are already aware that flowcharts are diagrammatic representations of algorithms. You know which symbols are used to draw flowcharts and the basic guidelines to draw them. You also know about their importance and usage.

### Guidelines for developing flowcharts

 - Flowchart should have only one start and one stop symbol

 - General flow of processes is top to bottom or left to right

 - Arrows should not cross each other

A step by step guide how to create and use flowcharts and different symbols used in them:

### Tools to draw flowcharts

Now, let’s discover some tools you can use to draw flowcharts. 

**1. Diagrams.net**

You can go to [website](https://www.diagrams.net/) and download the diagram drawing tool to draw flowcharts. It is easy to use and involves simple drag and drop to draw the symbols in the flowchart.

This is a fun way to draw flowcharts as opposed to the conventional pen and paper drawing.

**2. Flowgorithm**

A more amazing tool is Flowgorithm. Flowgorithm is a free beginner's programming language that is based on simple graphical flowcharts. It is closer to how you actually code to implement your logic in a programming language. In fact, it allows you to convert the flowcharts you create directly into the code of any programming language of your choice. You can convert your flowcharts into pseudo code as well. You can also run your programs directly in Flowgorithm.

For beginners, many programming languages can be frustratingly difficult. Many of them require you to write lines of confusing code just to display the text "Hello, world!". By using flowcharts, you can concentrate on programming concepts rather than all the nuances of a typical programming language.

But, if you don’t have experience with any programming language, it’s better to use diagrams.net for now and just focus on the problem solving aspect. When you’re more familiar with programming languages, Flowgorithm can be a great tool to use.

For windows user the flowgorithm software is directly accessible on [website](http://www.flowgorithm.org/), however for the Mac users please follow the instructions given in the video below:

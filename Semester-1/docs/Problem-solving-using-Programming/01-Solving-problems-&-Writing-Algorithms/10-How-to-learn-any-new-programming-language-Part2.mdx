# How to learn a new programming language(Lab) - Part 2

## Lesson Objective
You learnt the simple and beginner friendly language “LOGO” in the previous lesson. This lesson is a continuation of the previous lesson and goes into further detailed features of the language.

## Introduction to the lesson
You have already learnt around 20 basic commands used in LOGO programming in the previous lesson. We have also created a few shapes and figures using those commands. Let’s look at some more features and commands of LOGO that will give you more power for drawing more complex and amazing figures. This is a self-paced class too.

### The REPEAT Command
We often repeat a sequence of commands. Computer programs in general perform a lot of repetitive tasks. Just about every programming system has a way of carrying out this repetition, or iteration, as computer scientists call it. 

Let us consider the following example,
Let’s say we want to draw a square with sides of length 100, we can do this with the following sequence of commands –

`fd 100 rt 90 fd 100 rt 90 fd 100 rt 90 fd 100 rt 90`

We note that the commands – **fd 100 rt 90** are repeated *four times*. Will it not be simpler to tell the computer that it should just repeat these two commands four times instead of writing them four times in a row? We can do exactly this by using the REPEAT command.

**REPEAT n [instruction list]**

 - This command repeats the action listed in the instruction list n number of times.

 - To draw the square like in the above example, we would just have to write it as follows

 `repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]`

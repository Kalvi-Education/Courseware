## Lesson Objective
In the previous lessons we have discussed what hardware and software are. This lesson will talk about what system software is and its purpose in a computing device. You will learn the different types of system software and system utilities. Learning about the inner workings and parts of a computer will enable you to think differently and try different approaches when facing a coding problem.

## Introduction
As we know, system software is what drives the computerâ€™s hardware to work in a certain way according to the hardwares assigned functionalities. 

 - It is a platform on which the top level softwares like application software runs.

 - Designing a system software is a complicated task, since it is written in low level language or the machine level language.

System software is a type of **computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs**. It includes the programs that are dedicated to managing the computer itself, such as the operating system, file management utilities, and disk operating system (or DOS).

A system software program serves as a platform for other programs. 

Operating systems, antivirus programs, disc formatting programs, computer language translators, etc. are a few examples. 

These programs, which are used to communicate with the hardware in a very basic manner, are written in low-level languages. System software serves as the **interface between the hardware and the end users**.

## Types of system software

The functions and processes of computer hardware are all controlled and coordinated by the **five different types of systems software**. They actually make it possible for software, hardware, and users to communicate in a useful way.

Systems software performs intermediary duties to guarantee communication between hardware and other software to allow peaceful cohabitation with the user.

Let us see the 5 different types of system software now:

1. Operating System

2. Device Driver

3. Firmware

4. Translator

5. Utility

**Letâ€™s learn about each one of the system management software and its characteristics.**


#### 1. Operating System

An operating system is a system software which manages a computerâ€™s memory and processes along with its hardware and software. A computer can understand only machine level language, a user on the other hand understands high level language, barring these differences the operating system stands between the computer and user, allowing them to interact easily.


 - The main task of the OS is managing the resources i.e the CPUâ€™s processing capacity and the memory between all devices and processes. 

 - At any point of time, when a computer is active and running, there is a constant rivalry between all devices both internal and external to get a share of the CPU or the memory to finish their own tasks.

 - The OS acts as their leader and uses scheduling algorithms to decide which device gets to access the processor and the memory.

 - An OS comes preloaded in a computer when we buy, later on it can be upgraded or partitioned based on our requirements.

 - There are 3 most popular OSs being used worldwide, they are -**Microsoft Windows , Mac OS and Linux**.

#### 2. Device Driver

A device driver is a piece of software that instructs the operating system and any other software present in a computer as to how they should interact with all internal and external hardware. Device drivers are specific to each device that is installed in our computer. For example, every printer has its own device driver and needs to be installed in our system, which thereby connects the OS and the printer for us to easily use the printer via the OS.

We view a computer as a whole machine, but we need to understand that it is built by assembling and installing different hardware and software, each manufactured by a different company and speaks its own language. A device driver is a **translator** who breaks the language incompatibilities and makes communication between a  device and a program easy.

The files with extensions **.sys , .dll and .exe** are loadable device driver files used by Windows and iOS uses **.ko (kernel)** files.

#### 3. Firmware

A firmware is a piece of software which comes hardwired or embedded with the device itself. The embedded software within the device usually has a set of instructions that tell a device as to how it should communicate with other computer hardware. Firmware is typically found in the devicesâ€™ ROM and are updated from time to time to be compatible with the manufacturer's new software releases. So, firmware can be grouped under **flash-memory** even though it is placed inside a ROM (Read Only Memory).

Hardware components like network card, optical drive, router, media player or a scanner all have firmwares embedded in them.

### What is System development?
The system development process is carried out by a group of individual software programs called the **compiler, interpreter, assembler, loader, linker and the debugger**. Let us take a look into each of them to understand a little more about their importance and functions.

#### 1. Compiler

A compiler is a special kind of software that has the ability to convert high level language (source language or programming language) into a low level language (target language). The target language can also be called a machine code, assembly language or object code which is an executable program i.e a program which the computerâ€™s processor can understand and execute.

#### 2. Interpreter

A software which has the capability to convert a high level language into a machine level language line by line is called an interpreter. Even though the compiler does the same job as the interpreter, a compiler does the job of converting a source code completely into machine language and produces results. In case of a huge source code, the compiler might take hours to get the job done. In such cases an interpreter does the same job in a shorter time and delivers results after conversion of every line of the source code.

#### 3. Assembler

An assembler is a software that converts low level assembly code into machine language thereby generating information required for the loader to process.

#### 4. Linker

Linker is a software program that takes individual blocks of object code delivered by assembler and links it into a single executable file to be processed further.

#### 5. Loader

A loader is a software program which places the required libraries(executable program) and programs into the main memory for execution. The executable program received from the linker is read by the loader and makes it ready for running taking care of any additional programming tasks needed to be done.

#### 6. Debugger

A debugger is a software program that checks for errors at various stages of assembling, linking or loading and sends an error message requesting to debug the executable file for further processing.

### What are System utilities?

System utilities are a group of software designed to help the computer maintain its functionality in a smooth and flawless manner. Also called as utility software, these come inbuilt with the OS, but can be removed, modified or upgraded with proper admin permissions and their major function is infrastructure support for the computer system. Let us have a thorough understanding about the different types of utility software, from the following section.

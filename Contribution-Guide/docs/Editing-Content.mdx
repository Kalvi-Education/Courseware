## Adding images in the lesson
Images can be added to the lesson using the markdown format, as shown below.

**Code** 
`![Kalvi-logo](https://admission.kalvieducation.com/static/media/logo_red_1.05446df6a22995d6fcf77cdc5eae1559.svg)`

### Points to remember
- If you add text immediately after the image without giving any line space, then the text will be placed on the same line of the image on the output.
Here is an example:

**Code** 

![Adding image as inline](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/kalvi-education.github.io/front-end-web-development/Adding+image+as+inline.png)

**Output**

![Kalvi-logo](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/assets.ynos.in/startup-logos/YNOS402090.jpg)
This is Kalvi's logo

- To get the text, you are adding after the image to come in a new line. You should provide one line space between the image and the text.
Here is an example:

**Code** 

![Adding image as block](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/kalvi-education.github.io/front-end-web-development/Adding+image+as+a+Block+.png)

**Output**

![Kalvi-logo](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/assets.ynos.in/startup-logos/YNOS402090.jpg)

This is Kalvi's logo

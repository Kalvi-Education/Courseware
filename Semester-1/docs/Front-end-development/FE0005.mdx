Goal 3: Adding CSS to HTML

## What is CSS?

CSS is the language we use to style the HTML document and describes how HTML elements should be displayed. It can control the layout of multiple webpages at a time.

## Why use CSS?

CSS is used to define styles for the web pages which includes design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. The CSS code is saved in .css files. With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.

## How to add CSS to HTML document?

There are three ways to add CSS to HTML document.

-   External stylesheet
    

You can link the external CSS file to HTML document using `<link>` tag which is to be added inside the `<head>` of the HTML document.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

  

-   Internal stylesheet

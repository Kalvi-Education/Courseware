Let‚Äôs get started

First things first, let‚Äôs understand what is web development?

This is what Wikipedia says ‚ÄúWeb development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.‚Äù

Before we get started with FrontEnd, the very first step is to set up all the required environments to work with during the course. This way, there are no distractions in between. 


## Environment setup


### Installing VS Code

VS Code includes great tooling for web technologies such as JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON. Throughout the course, we'll be using the VS code extensively. It is not just an editor, the features supported by VS Code reduce the tasks of any developer significantly. Along with VS code, we will be installing a few additional extensions too.

System requirements for the VS Code:

Visual Studio Code is a small download (&lt; 100 MB) and has a disk footprint of 200 MB. VS Code is lightweight and should easily run on today's hardware.

**How to install VS Code?**

Open VS Code in your browser using this link -  [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Now VS code would have detected your OS.

Download and install VS Code for your system (follow the instructions for installation)

After installing VS Code editor, you need to install some basic plugins to make the platform a better place to code. So, install these as well:

ESLINT - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

BEAUTIFY - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)

PRETTIER - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

LIVE SERVER - [Click here to install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Now you‚Äôre all set with your environment.

Install/Update chrome

[Click here to download the installation file](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiKzR3_mC5wIVkIWPCh0S2AoxEAAYASABEgIsvvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

If prompted, click Run or Save.

If you have chosen Save, then double-click the downloaded file to begin the installation.

Now, start Chrome:

Windows 7: A Chrome window opens up once everything is done.

Windows 8 & 8.1: A welcome dialogue box appears. Click next to select your default browser.

Windows 10: A Chrome window opens up after everything is done. You can make Chrome your default browser.

üö® Note: If you've earlier used a different browser, like Internet Explorer or Safari or Edge, you can import your settings into Chrome.

If Chrome is already installed, make sure you have the latest version of it. To check this on your computer, open Chrome.

At the top right, click More (three dots option).

Click update Google Chrome.

Important: If you don't see this button, you're on the latest version.

Click relaunch.

What is Front End 

The fact that we could create this course and you could learn it online is not all easy. We all owe it to one person, Sir Tim Berners Lee, the brain behind the World Wide Web (www). He also created HTML and HTTP along with the first web page editor, the browser.

All these technologies helped him create the first website ever. Sounds interesting! So you see, that's how technology evolved.

And today, every website has two parts to it - Front End and Back End. You can probably visualize them this way,

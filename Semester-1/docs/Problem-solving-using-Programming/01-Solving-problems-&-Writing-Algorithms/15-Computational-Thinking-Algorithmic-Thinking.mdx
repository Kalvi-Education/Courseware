# Computational Thinking - Algorithmic Thinking

An algorithm is a process or formula for calculating answers, sorting data, and automating tasks; and algorithmic thinking is the process for developing an algorithm.

With algorithmic thinking, students endeavour to construct a step-by-step process for solving a problem and like problems so that the work is replicable by humans or computers.

> Algorithmic thinking is a derivative of computer science and the process to develop code and program applications. This approach automates the problem-solving process by creating a series of systematic, logical steps that intake a defined set of inputs and produce a defined set of outputs based on these.


In other words, algorithmic thinking is not solving for a specific answer; instead, it solves how to build a sequential, complete, and replicable process that has an end point – an algorithm. Designing an algorithm helps students to both communicate and interpret clear instructions for a predictable, reliable output. This is the crux of computational thinking.

## Examples of Algorithms in Everyday Life

Like computational thinking and its other elements we’ve discussed, algorithms are something we experience regularly in our lives.

If you’re an amateur chef or a frozen meal aficionado, you follow recipes and directions for preparing food, and that’s an algorithm.

Outlining a process for checking out books in a school library or instructions for cleaning up at the end of the day is developing an algorithm and letting your inner computer scientist shine.

## :art: An activity applying Algorithms:

Think of a problem for which you could use computational thinking, describe it, and then describe how you would apply Algorithms.

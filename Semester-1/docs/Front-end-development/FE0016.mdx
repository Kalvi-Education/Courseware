## What are CSS Selectors?

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors) describes “in CSS that selectors are used to select/target an HTML element and add styling to it. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, e.g simple, combination, pseudo, attribute selectors etc.”

  

Get ready for exploring all the different types of selectors.

  

By now we would have got a very good undertaking on “What are CSS Selectors”, let’s explore its types.

  

Here is an interesting [article by freecode camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-css-selectors-to-style-webpage/) which will help you understand CSS Selectors better.
